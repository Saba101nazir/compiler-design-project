This code implements a simple lexical analyzer (tokenizer) and a parser for a basic programming language. Here's a breakdown of its components and functionality:

1. Token Specification (token_specification)
The code defines a list of token specifications, where each token is represented by a tuple containing the token name and a regular expression pattern.
Tokens defined:
NUMBER: Matches integers.
IDENTIFIER: Matches variable names (alphanumeric and underscore, starting with a letter or underscore).
ASSIGN: Matches the assignment operator =.
END: Matches the statement terminator ;.
PLUS, MINUS, TIMES, DIVIDE: Matches arithmetic operators +, -, *, /.
LPAREN, RPAREN: Matches parentheses ( and ).
SKIP: Skips over spaces and tabs.
NEWLINE: Matches line endings (newlines).
MISMATCH: Catches any character that doesn't match the above patterns (used to handle errors).
2. Tokenization (tokenize function)
The tokenize function takes a string of code and converts it into a list of tokens, each represented by a tuple containing:
kind: The type of token (e.g., NUMBER, IDENTIFIER).
value: The actual string matched.
line_num: The line number where the token was found.
column: The position of the token in the line.
The function uses regular expressions to find matches for each token type in the input code.
It handles errors by raising a RuntimeError if an unexpected character (i.e., MISMATCH) is found.
3. Parser Class
The Parser class is responsible for analyzing the sequence of tokens to ensure they follow the grammar rules of the language.
Initialization (__init__)
Takes a list of tokens and initializes the position counter (pos) and a set of declared symbols (symbols) for semantic analysis.
Expect Method (expect)
Moves to the next token if the current token matches the expected type; otherwise, it raises a syntax error.
Error Handling (error)
Raises a SyntaxError if an unexpected token is encountered.
Parsing (parse)
Iterates through the tokens and processes each statement using the statement method.
Statements and Expressions
statement(): Determines the type of statement (assignment, number, or variable declaration).
var_decl(): Handles variable declarations (e.g., int x;).
assignment(): Handles assignments (e.g., x = 5;).
expression(), term(), factor(): Handle arithmetic expressions, including operations and parentheses.
4. Main Function (main)
The main function serves as the entry point of the program.
It prompts the user to enter code, which is then tokenized and parsed.
If the code follows the defined syntax, the parser completes successfully; otherwise, it reports errors.
5. Error Handling
The code handles syntax errors (e.g., unexpected tokens) and semantic errors (e.g., use of undeclared variables).
Errors are reported with a descriptive message, including the expected token type and the position of the error.
Usage
The user inputs a small program in the defined language. The code then tokenizes the input and attempts to parse it according to the defined rules.
If the input is valid, it outputs the tokens and confirms successful parsing. Otherwise, it reports errors with details.
This code is a simplified version of a compiler's front-end, specifically focusing on lexical analysis and parsing. It forms the basis for further steps, like code generation or interpretation.
